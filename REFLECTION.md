1. **What patterns or surprises did you notice?**
   I noticed I kept making small, reusable functions that each do one job. Writing guesses before testing helped me think more about what each function should give back. It made me slow down and think through the steps before running the code.
2. **What logic challenged your thinking?**
   One part that made me think a little harder was making sure my statements were right, especially for the functions isEven() and isOdd(). It was easy to get true and false mixed up at first, but trying out my code helped me find mistakes quickly. Fixing errors got easier as I practiced running my functions in Git Bash and looking at what happened.
3. **How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?**
   This toolkit is useful for real projects because the functions can be reused in larger programs. Developers often need to do quick math checks, and having these functions saves time. Overall, this assignment helped me learn how to split problems into smaller parts and how version control keeps track of my work over time.
